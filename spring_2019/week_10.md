## Last Week's Accomplishments
Helped teammates to refactor crawler python code: changed from bs4 to lxml, which makes the job way easier

## This Week's Plan
Build frontend html and js models for each "dish item"
Also work on slides for presentation

## Anything Blocking?
Not familiar with MVC model with php. Need to meet with team more often
