## Last Week's Accomplishments

Been thinking about the 'doability' of packing the game into a client (executable file) written in python and freeze it.

## This Week's Plan

Continue implementing the basic logic for character and camera movement, maybe make backpack work.

## Anything Blocking?

For the pack and ship part, I am not familiar with GUI programming in python, so have to read docs about that.
Also, too many exams comming up, may not be able to code as much.
